## About Factories

Laravel allows you to define a set of default attributes for each of your Eloquent models using model factories


example of use in tinker

App\Models\Tag::factory()->withJobs()->create();
withJobs is a customiced method

App\Models\Job::factory(10)->create();
the last command will create 10 records
check the factory models for specific examples

notice the fake() function used in the factory this can generate data depending on the method, for example:
fake()->jobTitle() will generate a job title choosen by laravel itself
