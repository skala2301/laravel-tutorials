## About Components

Components in blade are created as a file into components directory
this file has the componetname.blade.php
they have the following structure:
<x-componetname>
    <x-slot name='variable_name'>
        variable_value
    </xslot>
    slot
</x-componetname>

by default they include the variable $slot which is the child of the component

the <x-slot> can be used as a variable inside the component

a component includes some attributes which can be accessed as {{$attributes}} or you can get specific attributes like this:
$attributes->get('attrubute_name') 

To see an example check the nav-link.blade.php file
you can also add data as props for which you can see an example in nav-link.blade.php file
