## About views

Views are the files which are used to show each page, the views included on this example are:
    contacts
    jobs
    welcome
    job

in each file you may see reference to some variables which you may wonder where have they been declared
and the answer is they have been passed from the controller (actually they are being passed on the function used in the Route)

As an example if you check the jobs.blade.php file there is the $jobs variable which has been passed from routes like this:
Route::get('/jobs', function () {
    $jobs = Job::all();
    return view('jobs', ['jobs' => $jobs]);
});

you may notice there is this function Job::all()
this is from a model called Job with an static function all() go to the app/Models directory to see more details

Go to app/Models to see the Models example, specially Job which was the one made from scratch
Go to resource/views/components/README for an explanation about components
